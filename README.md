# Floating Words

## About
**Floating Words** is an AR translation app for Android. It allows users to point their smartphone camera at a real-world object, and the app automatically creates a 3D AR anchor at that position with the translated label of the object. This vocabulary is stored in a permanent dictionary that can be accessed for detailed information about each word. In addition, the app provides a "Flashcards" feature for revising and studying newly added vocabs. Finally, a screenshot of the real object is stored for each word, so that the user has a visual reference to the vocab in question.
